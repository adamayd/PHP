# PHP

This repo contains the personal solution files for courses and tutorials in PHP.  I tend to stray from the course work on purpose to build projects I like/want and to force myself not to understand what I'm typing, not copy it.  For that reason I don't recommend using my solutions as reference to any of the courses I've listed.  Please feel free to look through them and see how I've done things differently.

Comments, issues, and pull requests are welcome!  Let's learn together!!

** Note: ** Courses containing PHP that are related specifically to WordPress will be in the WordPress repo
